# TOPSIS for Text Generation Model Selection üèÜ

**A systematic approach to select the best pre-trained text generation model using TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution).**

---

## üìå Overview
This repository provides a framework to **objectively rank pre-trained text generation models** (e.g., GPT-2, T5, BART) using the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making method. By evaluating models across performance, computational efficiency, and practicality metrics, you can identify the optimal model for your use case.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Criteria-Based Evaluation**: Compare models using metrics like BLEU, perplexity, inference speed, and ease of use.
- **Customizable Weights**: Prioritize criteria (e.g., speed vs. accuracy) based on your needs.
- **TOPSIS Implementation**: Transparent and reproducible ranking algorithm.
- **Python Script**: Ready-to-use code for automated calculations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/topsis-text-generation.git
